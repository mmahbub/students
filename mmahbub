I am Maria Mahbub, a first year Data Science and Engineering Ph. D. student. I have completed my Bachelor and Master in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics respectively. I have worked on blood flow and Navier Stokes equations in my Masters thesis. I like coding and data analysis. In free time, I like to travel around, play badminton and hang out with my friends and family.
